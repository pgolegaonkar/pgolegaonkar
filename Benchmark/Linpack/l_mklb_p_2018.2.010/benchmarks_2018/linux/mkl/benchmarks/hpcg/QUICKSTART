NOTE: The instructions in this file assume you are working with a version
      of the software from the HPCG repository, or have already unpacked
      the hpcg distribution tar file.  We assume you are in the main hpcg
      directory.  Furthermore, we assume that the environment has been properly
      set to use Intel(R) C/C++ Compiler 16.0, Intel(R) MKL 2018, and Intel(R)
      MPI 5.1 or later versions (to do this, use the scripts compilervars.sh,
      mklvars.sh, and mpivars.sh included in those distributions).

1) Review the collection of setup files in 'hpcg/setup'.  Determine which of
   these files is usable for your system, or create a new file of your own
   with appropriate parameters, starting from an existing file if you like.
   Note the suffix of the file Make.suffix (e.g., Make.IMPI_IOMP_AVX2 has the
   suffix IMPI_IOMP_AVX2).

   Example commands:
      ls setup
      cp setup/Make.IMPI_IOMP_AVX2 setup/Make.My_MPI_OMP
      vi setup/Make.My_MPI_OMP

2) Create a build directory under the main hpcg directory (or somewhere else on
   your system).  Give the directory a meaningful name such as 'My_MPI_OpenMP'.

   Example command:
      mkdir My_MPI_OpenMP

3) 'cd' to your build directory, and run the configure command located in the
   main hpcg directory, defining the path and file argument to be the location
   of the setup file defined in step 1.  Then run 'make'.  Note that if your
   main hpcg directory is not located within an Intel MKL distribution, then you
   must additionally specify MKL_INCLUDE and MKLROOT as command line arguments.

   Example commands:
      cd My_MPI_OpenMP
      path_to_hpcg/configure My_MPI_OMP
      make [MKL_INCLUDE=path_to_include MKLROOT=path_to_root]

4) If make is successful, you will have a 'bin' directory containing the files
   'hpcg.dat' and 'xhpcg'.  'cd' to the bin directory and run the benchmark.

   Example commands to run on a 128-node cluster with two Intel(R) Xeon(R)
   Processor E5-2697 v4 per node with problem size 192 for 60 seconds:
      cd bin
      export OMP_NUM_THREADS=18
      export KMP_AFFINITY=granularity=fine,compact,1,0
      mpiexec.hydra -genvall -n 256 -ppn 2 ./xhpcg_avx2 -n192 -t60

5) The benchmark has completed execution.  This should take a few minutes
   when running in evaluation mode, and take about 30 minutes in official
   benchmark mode.  If you are running on a production system, you may be able
   to submit results using the Quick Path option, which executes in minimum
   time.  When the run is complete, you will see a file called
   'n[size]-[nodes]p-[threads]t-[version]_[timestamp].yaml'.  You will also see
   a log file called 'hpcg_log_[timestamp].txt.  The official results from your
   run are in the .yaml file.  The final two lines of the file declare whether
   or not the results are valid, and explain how to report them.

   Example commands:
      less n192-256p-18t-V3.0_2018.01.09.09.53.28.yaml

6) If results are valid, you may upload them to http://hpcg-benchmark.org.
   If results are not valid, do not submit them.
